                    I spend I large amount of my time outside of work and school going on adventures with my son and girlfriend. I also enjoy playing both video and board games, and hanging out with friends. I've included a couple of my biggest non-digital hobbies below.

                    Dungeons & Dragons (often abbreviated as D&D) is a cooperative, role-playing game where you and your friends create unique characters and embark on thrilling adventures. At its core, D&D is a collaborative storytelling experience. Players create characters by choosing from various races, classes, and backgrounds, before venturing into a fantasy world where the story unfolds.

                Warhammer 40,000 (often abbreviated as 40K) is a captivating tabletop wargame that combines strategy, creativity, and a dash of luck. It is a blend of miniature modeling, storytelling, and intense battles—a universe where heroes, villains, and cosmic horrors clash across the stars.
